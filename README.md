# flight-delay-predictor-XGBOOST
Machine learning project predicting flight delay risk using operational and historical data. An XGBoost model achieved strong ranking performance (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.93) under time-based validation. Cost-based analysis showed automated alerts add limited value, so the model is deployed as a risk-ranking decision support tool for operations teams.
